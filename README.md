# Colour Scheme <br>

![colors and pics used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abbc9cfd-0411-44d2-bd77-322732598611)

Given the relaxing nature of the topic, I aimed to maintain a minimal and dark color scheme to avoid overwhelming kids. I used basic, famous colors like blue orange gradiant for header in the CSS to create a fun time experience for kids. The codes for the colors used are as follows: <br>
•	Body (Background Color): rgb(16, 99, 129) <br>
•	Header/Text: linear-gradient(45deg, orange 15%, red 35%, yellow 80%);<br>
•	Container: rgb(21, 214, 224) <br>
•	Reset and Start Button(Background-colour): #0bad26;<br>
•	Reset and Start Button(Text colour): White <br>

# Typography <br>
I have used fonts arial, sans-sariff and Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma as back up. Font sizes i have chosen 3 rem 2 rem and 1 rem. <br>

# Wireframes <br>
Wireframes were created for Main Design stays same when screen changes its size. <br>
